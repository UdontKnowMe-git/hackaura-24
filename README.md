## Notes

Gemini API: https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/quickstart?lang=python
refer to above link to get familiar with the syntax and such

Supabase: https://supabase.com/
The database system we will be using (free and awesome)

If we need to make an online website i recommend using react/next.js
We will stick to python for backend tasks such as API calls and live chat
