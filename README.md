# hackaura-24
This project is being made for the upcoming Hackaura by VITAura 2024

## Todo:
- ~~Get an AI API key~~ Powered by gemini-flash-1.5
- ~~Database system~~ Using supabase
- Get an idea to work on
- Make the ppt
- Code the frontend/backend (if any)

## Current ideas:
- None

## Notes

Gemini API: https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/quickstart?lang=python
refer to above link to get familiar with the syntax and such

Supabase: https://supabase.com/
The database system we will be using (free and awesome)

If we need to make an online website i recommend using react/next.js
We will stick to python for backend tasks such as API calls and live chat


Quick github tutorial: 
- First install Git from https://git-scm.com/
- Set up git using:
```
$ git config --global user.name "John Doe"
$ git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com
```
- Then go to this repository and copy its link,
- Go to vscode or terminal and type in 
`git clone https://github.com/UdontKnowMe-git/hackaura-24`

- This will add the repository to ur pc then you can start editing and stuff
```git branch new-branch-name
git checkout new-branch-name```

- Before starting any edits to code, make sure to create a seperate branch and then merge only if you find no errors in your current working branch

- After making changes write the following sequence of commands to push your changes to github
```git add .
git commit -m "Commit message"
git push origin your-branch-name```
